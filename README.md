Snake Game Specs

----------------------------------------
Core Mechanics:
----------------------------------------
- Levels: 10 total; each level requires snake length = previous level's length + 10 (Level 1 = 10, Level 2 = 20, … Level 10 = 100).
- Growth: Snake grows after every 2 food items.
- Lives: 3 lives per game. After level 5, hearts spawn with a 20% chance as extra food for 10 seconds to refill a life.
- Auto-play: Toggle between manual and AI-controlled navigation.
- Start/Pause: Standard controls.

----------------------------------------
Star Rating (Per Level):
----------------------------------------
- 3 Stars: Complete level without losing any lives.
- 2 Stars: Complete level with 1 life lost.
- 1 Star: Complete level with 2 lives lost and if the level takes >100 seconds.

----------------------------------------
Visual Features:
----------------------------------------
- Level-Specific Snake Designs:
  1. Neon: Glowing pulse effect.
  2. Cyber: Circuit pattern.
  3. Crystal: Shimmer effect.
  4. Energy: Particle trails.
  5. Plasma: Wave patterns.
  6. Digital: Matrix segments.
  7. Laser: Beam connections.
  8. Hologram: Transparency.
  9. Quantum: Phase shifting.
  10. Ultimate: Combined visual effects.
- Growth Effects: A ghost segment appears after the first food collection and solidifies after the second; particle effects occur on food collection.

----------------------------------------
Controls:
----------------------------------------
- Keyboard: Arrow keys or WASD.
- Touch: On-screen directional buttons.
- Mouse: Click in desired direction.
- Auto-Mode: AI-controlled navigation when toggled.

----------------------------------------
Themes:
----------------------------------------
- Available Themes: Default, Dark, Forest (toggle via palette button).

----------------------------------------
Technical Details:
----------------------------------------
- Rendering: Pure HTML5 Canvas.
- UI: Material Design.
- Layout: Responsive and mobile-optimized.
- Performance: Efficient collision detection and smooth animations.
- Code Structure: Modular design with separate files for key components:
    • engine.js – Core game loop and level progression.
    • snake.js – Snake behavior (movement, growth, collision).
    • food.js – Food generation (including hearts/power-ups).
    • level.js – Level requirements and management.
    • ui.js – UI interactions (start/pause, theme toggle, star rating display).
    • input.js – Unified input handling (keyboard, touch, mouse, auto-mode).
    • renderer.js – Canvas drawing routines and animations.
all js files should be as independent as possible to allow for individual files to be debugged and developed independently. this is very important.
----------------------------------------
Notes:
----------------------------------------
- The spec is designed to be concise for efficient development.
- Expand individual modules as needed based on project complexity.

the viewport of the game should be fixed
the game should support arrow keys and wasd keys for moving the snake
the game should support touch swipe gestures.
there should be a mute toggle button for sounds which should be muted by default
the sounds should be generated by API
remember - efficient and error freere constrained
