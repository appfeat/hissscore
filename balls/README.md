# Balls Game Requirements

- Oval playing area with visible borders.
- Hero ball (contrasting color to enemy ball) controlled via arrow keys.
- Evil balls generated gradually; spawn rate and speed increase over time.
- Initial hero ball size is 1.4Ã— enemy ball size.
- When hero collides with a smaller enemy, it absorbs it and grows (using area-based scaling).
- If two enemy balls collide, the bigger absorbs the smaller using the same rule.
- The game ends when either the hero ball becomes the biggest (Player Wins) or an enemy ball overtakes the hero (World Wins).
